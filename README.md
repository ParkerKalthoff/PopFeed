PopFeed 🎈
Welcome to PopFeed, a Twitter clone being developed by me, using Django and Angular! This project is an exploration of Django Rest Framework, pagination techniques, and an opportunity for me to enhance my skills in both Angular and Django frameworks. 🚀

Project Overview
PopFeed is a social media platform that allows users to share their thoughts, ideas, and updates with the world. Here are some of the basic functionalities of the site:

🔁 Pops (Tweets): I can create pops (limited to 280 characters, just like tweets) to express myself and share content with others.

🔍 Search and Discovery: I can search for other users, pops, or hashtags to discover interesting content and connect with like-minded individuals.

👥 Follow and Connect: I can follow other users to stay updated with their pops and build a network of connections within the platform.

🌟 Likes and Interactions: I can engage with pops by liking them and leaving comments, fostering conversations and interactions among the community.

📜 Pagination: I utilize pagination techniques to display pops in a user-friendly manner, loading and presenting a subset of pops at a time. This improves performance and provides a smooth browsing experience.

Technologies Used
🔧 Django: A powerful Python-based web framework that I use to build the backend server and handle data storage and retrieval.

🚀 Django Rest Framework (DRF): I leverage DRF to create RESTful APIs that power my frontend and handle functionalities such as authentication, data serialization, and pagination.

🖥️ Angular: A popular JavaScript framework that I use to build the frontend user interface of PopFeed, providing an interactive and dynamic experience.

📄 SQLite: The default database system for Django, used to store user profiles, pops, and other data.
